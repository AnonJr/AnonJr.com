Michal Gabrukiewicz and a number of [other contributors](http://www.asp-ajaxed.org/about/) created an awesome library for those using [ASP Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages). Michal passed away, but the site remained active.

In mid-2013 the official site disappeared. I was able to contact one of the other programmers that worked with Michal and received permission to take ownership of the project. I've kept the [official site](http://www.asp-ajaxed.org/) and the (now inactive) Google Code Project going since then.

With Google "retiring" Google Code, I set up [an organization](https://github.com/ASP-Ajaxed) and [moved the code](https://github.com/ASP-Ajaxed/asp-ajaxed) to GitHub. There's a re-design for the official site in progress, and a move to GitHub pages, but no ETA as work, school, and life in general have curtailed some of my free time.
