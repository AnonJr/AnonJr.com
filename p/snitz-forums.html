<h2>Snitz Forums</h2>
<p>Back in 2004, my boss asked me to integrate a support forum into our LMS. Since the system was written in ASP Classic, I looked through my options and settled on Snitz Forums.</p>
<p>I've been an active member in the <a href="http://forum.snitz.com/forum/default.asp">support forums</a> for this project ever since - helping others, contributing various extensions, and working with the core dev team on the 3.4.07 release.</p>
<p>I've not been as active as I'd like these days, but hopefully that will change soon&hellip;</p>
