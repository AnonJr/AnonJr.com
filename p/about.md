# Who am I?

That's a question I ask myself every day...

Most would want to peg me as an IT "Jack of all Trades" given my experience, capacity, and capability in graphics design, web programming, and server administration. I've even done some photography and acquired a wide assortment of other skills. But all that sort of implies the "Master of None", which isn't quite right either&hellip; so let's go with a modern [Renaissance Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath#Renaissance_ideal:_the_Renaissance_man).

As noted, I've done, and am mostly comfortable with, full stack development. I've been an educator, a coach (youth soccer, High School swimming), I've done some factory work, and I'm starting up a [podcast](http://biblebyexample.com) rooted in my love of theology.
