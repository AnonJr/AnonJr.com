<h2>ASP-Ajaxed</h2>
<p>Michal Gabrukiewicz and a number of <a href="http://www.asp-ajaxed.org/about/">other contributors</a> created an awesome library for those using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages">ASP Classic</a>. Michal passed away, but the site remained active.</p>
<p>In mid-2013 the official site disappeared. I was able to contact one of the other programmers that worked with Michal and received permission to take ownership of the project. I've kept the <a href="http://www.asp-ajaxed.org/">official site</a> and the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/asp-ajaxed/">Google Code Project</a> going since then.</p>
<p>With Google looking more and more like they're going to "retire" Google Code, I plan on moving the code to GitHub. There's also a plan to re-design for the official site, but no ETA as work, school, and life in general have curtailed some of my free time.</p>
