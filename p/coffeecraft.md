CoffeeCraft is a small, [HermitCraft](http://hermitcraft.com/)-like Minecraft server and podcast built with my sister and her husband. The three of us plan on posting weekly videos independently, a few live streams, and a few collaborative projects.

We're currently in what we're calling "Season 00", a private session where we get set up and start working out the rules for the server and how we're going to operate. Later in 2019 we'll start streaming and recording once we get a few more things settled.

The website has been started, and you can watch the progress over at [CoffeeCraft.us](https://www.coffeecraft.us/).
