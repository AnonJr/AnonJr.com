I outlined some projects I've had on the back burner in [Projects Projects Projects]({% post_url 2018-11-02-Projects-Projects-Projects %}), now it's time to start digging into each and getting a sense of where they are and what needs to be done.

Even though the podcast itself may not necessary be a fit for the Dev.to community, I'm going to cross-post this there as an example of a project assessment, and as part of a larger series on the tech/project management aspects of building a podcast.

I'm going to be as clear as I can which aspects would be good for any show, and which are things that I personally think should be done. I'll do the same for Bible By Example, which should provide some interesting comparisons for two similar projects.

The newest of the projects I've got on my list is CoffeeCraft.us, a [HermitCraft](http://hermitcraft.com/)-like Minecraft podcast built with my sister and her husband. The three of us plan on posting weekly videos independently, a few live streams, and a few collaborative projects.

First bit, and one I've been stalling on, is getting an email, YouTube, and Twitter accounts set up for the show. You're going to see this at the top of a few of these projects&hellip;

The Twitter part is easy to understand, ditto for the YouTube account. I'm not going to set them up though until I get a project email going. I could technically attach it to my main account or at least set it up under one of my existing email addresses. Having said that, and what follows is a personal thing, I don't want my projects tied to my private email address. I don't want someone causing problems with the project causing problems with my personal communications.

Which brings us to making sure all my projects have their own email address. I've been waffling on exactly where I'm setting this up, and that's probably a topic for a solo article given just how many projects are being held up by it.

Next part, make sure I've got a domain and website lined up. I find it very funny (maybe not the "ha ha" kind of funny) that I did a check for "coffeecraft.com", found it free, and a couple days later when I went to buy it found the domain "reserved" by GoDaddy but available for an increased cost. Screw that. I bought "coffeecraft.us".

Side note for those who have never bought a .us domain, apparently you can't do private registration (or at least not through 1and1.com, who I've been using for domains and hosting). I've never had so many spam calls as the months after I registered the domain. There was a whole lot of "If I didn't call you I don't want it", and for those that thought the high-pressure sales would break through there was some "I miss the old days, when you could hear the receiver slam down".

I downloaded one of the Jekyll templates from [Michael Rose/Made Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes). I've been very happy with the assortment of his templates and you're going to see a couple different ones employed in my more recent projects.

Fortunately, if you want to see the customizations I've made, the [CoffeeCraft.us site is in a public repo on GitHub](https://github.com/AnonJr/CoffeeCraft.us). *Un*fortunately, I've not accomplished much more than downloading the stock template and starting to get the logo where I want it.

My plan is to use some of the textures from the game itself for the major design elements. I need to email Xisumavoid, the website administrator for Hermitcraft, about some of the things he's done with their site.

When it comes to the actual broadcasting, I'm going to use XSplit to manage the stream, and send it out to Restream.io for broadcast to YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, and maybe one or two other services. I still need a couple assets for XSplit, like setting up the scenes and that sort of thing. Good thing the hardware is essentially set. I've done a few one-off recording/broadcasting bits, so I've got an MXL990 microphone and a few different interfaces for hooking it up to the PC. I've got a decent enough camera from another project, I just need to re-mount it on my new desk. My sister made a beautiful blue backdrop so there's no distracting window over my shoulder.

As for the game itself, we've got a server up locally that's good enough for the three of us. My old Alienware MX17 laptop is now doing double-duty as the media center and Minecraft server. We ran our previous server for a while with little trouble, and we've been running a "Season 00" map since 1.13 was released and for the most part it's been running great.

Of course, all the prep and work is nothing without actually recording and broadcasting. :smiley:

Once I get the email and YouTube set up, I'll start doing some test recording/editing/posting.
