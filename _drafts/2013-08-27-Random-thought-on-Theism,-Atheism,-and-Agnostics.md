Reading through Meta today and the question "[Stack Overflow has taken up religion!](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/194725/25163)" caught my eye. Simple enough error - the Android app had a bug that caused the wrong logo to show next to Stack Overflow in the site list.

What caught my eye, and triggered this little random thought, was a comment to the answer:

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-na-2221-uy4/Uh0vR3VdL-I/AAAAAAAAAvo/KcmhmaRNhao/s1600/2013-08-27+18_56_28-mSOScreencap.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="105" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-na-2221-uy4/Uh0vR3VdL-I/AAAAAAAAAvo/KcmhmaRNhao/s400/2013-08-27+18_56_28-mSOScreencap.png" width="400"></a></div>
In case that's too small to read:
<blockquote class="tr_bq">Agnostic means you believe there is a god, but aren't sure of anything else. Or something else like that. Atheist means you don't believe in a god.&nbsp;</blockquote>Which I knew to be partly incorrect - but on looking for sources to link to, I found that I wasn't exactly correct either.

[From the mostly trusty Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism):
<blockquote class="tr_bq">Agnosticism is the view that the truth values of certain claims—especially claims about the existence or non-existence of any deity, as well as other religious and metaphysical claims—are (currently) unknown. Agnosticism can be defined in various ways, and is sometimes used to indicate doubt or a skeptical approach to questions. In some senses, agnosticism is a stance about the difference between belief and knowledge, rather than about any specific claim or belief.</blockquote>&nbsp;And in the next sentence we come to what I'd always attributed to the term:
<blockquote class="tr_bq">In the popular sense, an agnostic is someone who neither believes nor disbelieves in the existence of a deity or deities, whereas a theist and an atheist believe and disbelieve, respectively.</blockquote>There's a lot more to the term, which would be why this took far longer to write than it should have&hellip; and I'm not even at the thought I'd planned on writing down.

What it got me thinking about was the large number of atheists who really ought to be self-described agnostics if they were to truly live by the standards they claim.
