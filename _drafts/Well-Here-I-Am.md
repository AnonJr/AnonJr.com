First, if you've managed to make it this long without watching the awesome (and cancelled too soon) show Firefly, get your popcorn and Netflix/Amazon Prime/whatever going and enjoy a weekend binge.

This scene came to mind when the idea for this post first came together. I certainly feel adrift, in space, with nothing more than the ability to say "Well, here I am." Right now I’m dealing with near crippling levels of burnout, an unhealthy work environment, and chronic sleep problems. Oh, and all the things that come with them. :/

I’m working on getting some things in my current job cleaned up so it’s not as big a cluster for the next guy, and so the pool of applicants for my replacement can be a little broader. Basically I want to be the opposite of those horror stories you hear about what “the last guy left behind”. No matter what, once that’s done I’m quitting.

I’m trying to get a few projects lined up:

I’m almost done rebuilding two of my websites – one for my personal blog (which I’m restarting after the last false-start&hellip;), one for some side jobs I’ve done that I’m going to work into some part-time income.

I’m in the planning stages for a podcast, one I hope to be able to eventually turn into a small income stream.

I’m restarting work on a campaign setting I was building with my sister and her husband.

I’m starting work on two novels rooted in the above campaign setting. I’d love for both the game and the books to become something awesome and synergistic – I’ll gladly settle for one or the other taking root. I like the world we’re building and I just want to play in it. 🙂

My hopes are that one or more of these will become enough of an income to cover the bills. My end goal is to get enough different things going that I can safely not count on any one source of income, because that is what’s made leaving this job the hardest. I want to be in a place that if something isn’t working I have the flexibility to drop it and start something else.

The burnout is making this very hard, and depression has started coming along for the ride. Your writing, Ken White over at Popehat.com, Jenny Lawson’s books have all helped. My faith has been my anchor. I’ve been in bad places before. I will get past this and on to the next phase of life.
