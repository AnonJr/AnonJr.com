It's been quite a while since I last posted much of anything beyond a point update to a the [Custom Wandering Trader Sounds]({% post_url 2022-03-06-Custom-Wandering-Trader-Sounds-1.0.2 %}) and the [Custom Villager Sounds]({% post_url 2022-03-06-Custom-Villager-Sounds-1.0.3 %}) Resource Packs for Minecraft. So&hellip; what happened? (Besides this sitting in draft since October 2022&hellip;)

## First Things First
As I've tried to clumsily mention a few times before, I hit some serious burnout at a previous job. I didn't seek out the help I should have when I did and from that I've suffered bouts of moderate to severe depression. In 2021 I got hit by a big one, but this episode was rather deeper than usual and very tenacious. While I managed to continue the [CoffeeCraft] live stream, and some sort of Friday content, Games Revisited stagnated. The [CoffeeCraft] website was neglected. It also deeply impacted my work.

After some time I finally started seeking the help I should have sought years ago. But that's another article for another day. The relevant part for today's post is that in addition to therapy, the doctor tried to find some medications to help the process. One particular left me feeling rather miserable, and I started the usual withdrawal process.

End of August 2022 I was out of work for a week, feeling especially miserable. And when it didn't abate, I went to the ER thinking this was just a rough med withdrawal. I remember admission, vaguely remember a CT scan and an ambulance trip. Next thing I know I'm at the Duke ICU being told I have Acute Leukemia. I spent the next 2 1/2 years or so fighting Leukemia. I was out of work for a little over a year, going through chemo, radiation, and regular long visits to the hospital. Feb 2023 - Valentine's Day no less - I went through a bone marrow transplant. It wasn't until October 2023 I could return to work in any capacity. Turns out, one of the anti-rejection meds causes me to have rather problematic hand tremors. Not the best thing for someone who repairs/refurbishes stringed instruments and regularly uses blades, chisels, bandsaws, and belt sanders.

After some rather frequent use of time off options, I've been back to work for a while now. At my appointment in Feb 2025 I was declared officially in remission. I am currently, and have been since Feb, at that frustrating &ldquo;almost back to normal&rdquo;. Coupled (related to?) a resurgence of depression, I've been struggling to get all sorts of things back on track.

## Still a Miracle
Though I could, and do, complain about the cognitive and memory issues I still have as of writing this, it is still a miracle I'm here. And even more so a miracle I'm doing as well as I am. I went into the ER that day thinking I was just ill or going through a bad med withdrawal. I later found out I had 52 brain bleeds (2 major, 50 minor). The ER doctor didn't know that some of the blood factors could return results with those numbers and someone still be alive. When they started filtering out the malformed red blood cells (RBC), I was apparently at or near 98% blasts (malformed RBC). The odd pain I had in my side was apparently my left lung starting to collapse.

## CoffeeCraft and Minecraft Resource Packs

## Live Streaming

## Bible By Example
[Bible by Example] has been one of those projects that's been on my heart for years, though due to internal confliction, I've not made any real progress on it. On the one hand, I have no degree or formal training. It's the sort of thing that makes me wonder why anyone would care two shits about what I had to say. On the other hand, the Peter of the Gospels and the Peter of Acts were different - and not because Peter went to some "40 Days to a Better Rabbi" book, but because of the empowerment of the Holy Spirit. If the Lord could use Peter, surely he can use me as well.

## Wayward Son Developers, D20 Project, and ASP-Ajaxed
These projects have also been on hold for a bit. Once I get the [CoffeeCraft] and [Bible by Example] sites finished and settled, I'll update [Wayward Son Developers] and make it a better portfolio type site. The others I'll start picking up shortly thereafter.

## Wrapping it up
I really feel like I've forgotten something, but at this hour that's not surprising all things considered. I'll try to get the backlog of live stream archives up - apologies to those keeping tabs via RSS. Hopefully I'll be writing more and more varied in the future too. That's the plan, time will tell if I can manage it.
