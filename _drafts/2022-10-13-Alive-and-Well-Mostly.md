Well. It's been a little over a year since I last posted much of anything beyond a point update to a the [Custom Wandering Trader Sounds]({% post_url 2022-03-06-Custom-Wandering-Trader-Sounds-1.0.2 %}) and the [Custom Villager Sounds]({% post_url 2020-05-24-Custom-Villager-Sounds-1.0.3 %}) Resource Packs for Minecraft. Time to rectify that.

## First Things First
So&hellip; what happened? As I've tried to clumsily mention a few times before, I hit some serious burnout at a previous job. I didn't seek out the help I should have when I did and from that I've suffered bouts of moderate depression. Last year I got hit by a big one, but this one was rather deeper than usual and very tenacious.

## CoffeeCraft and Minecraft Resource Packs

## Live Streaming

## Bible By Example
[Bible by Example] has been one of those projects that's been on my heart for years, though due to internal confliction, I've not made any real progress on it. On the one hand, I have no degree or formal training. It's the sort of thing that makes me wonder why anyone would care two shits about what I had to say. On the other hand, the Peter of the Gospels and the Peter of Acts were different - and not because Peter went to some "40 Days to a Better Rabbi" book, but because of the empowerment of the Holy Spirit. If the Lord could use Peter, surely he can use me as well.

## Wayward Son Developers, D20 Project, and ASP-Ajaxed
These projects have also been on hold for a bit. Once I get the [CoffeeCraft] and [Bible by Example] sites finished and settled, I'll update [Wayward Son Developers] and make it a better portfolio type site. The others I'll start picking up shortly thereafter.

## Wrapping it up
I really feel like I've forgotten something, but at this hour that's not surprising all things considered. I'll try to get the backlog of live stream archives up - apologies to those keeping tabs via RSS. Hopefully I'll be writing more and more varied in the future too. That's the plan, time will tell if I can manage it.
