Well. It's been a little over a year since I last posted much of anything beyond a point update to a the [Custom Wandering Trader Sounds]({% post_url 2022-03-06-Custom-Wandering-Trader-Sounds-1.0.2 %}) and the [Custom Villager Sounds]({% post_url 2020-05-24-Custom-Villager-Sounds-1.0.3 %}) Resource Packs for Minecraft. So&hellip; what happened?

## First Things First
As I've tried to clumsily mention a few times before, I hit some serious burnout at a previous job. I didn't seek out the help I should have when I did and from that I've suffered bouts of moderate depression. Last year I got hit by a big one, but this one was rather deeper than usual and very tenacious. While I managed to continue the [CoffeeCraft] live stream, and some sort of Friday content, Games Revisited stagnated. It also deeply impacted my work.

After some time I finally started seeking the help I should have sought years ago. But that's another article for another day. The relevant part for today's post is that in addition to therapy, the doctor tried to find some medications to help the process. One particular left me feeling rather miserable, and I started the usual withdrawral process.

End of August I was out of work for a week, feeling especially miserable. And when it didn't abate, I went to the ER thinking this was just a rough med withdrawral. I remember admission, vaguely remember a CT scan and an ambulance trip. Next thing I know I'm at the Duke ICU being told I have Acute Leukimia.

## Bible By Example
[Bible by Example] has been one of those projects that's been on my heart for years, though due to internal confliction, I've not made any real progress on it. On the one hand, I have no degree or formal training. It's the sort of thing that makes me wonder why anyone would care two shits about what I had to say. On the other hand, the Peter of the Gospels and the Peter of Acts were different - and not because Peter went to some "40 Days to a Better Rabbi" book, but because of the empowerment of the Holy Spirit. If the Lord could use Peter, surely he can use me as well.

## Wayward Son Developers, D20 Project, and ASP-Ajaxed
These projects have also been on hold for a bit. Once I get the [CoffeeCraft] and [Bible by Example] sites finished and settled, I'll update [Wayward Son Developers] and make it a better portfolio type site. The others I'll start picking up shortly thereafter.

## Wrapping it up
I really feel like I've forgotten something, but at this hour that's not surprising all things considered. I'll try to get the backlog of live stream archives up - apologies to those keeping tabs via RSS. Hopefully I'll be writing more and more varied in the future too. That's the plan, time will tell if I can manage it.
