Today Rayeste and I get some of the fit and finish done on our Village Rehab project, with the goal that we get it ready to populate by the end of the season &hellip; which is rapidly approaching. At the time of posting, last live stream of Season 00 will be the last Tuesday  of the year (New Year's Eve), and the start of Season 1 will be a special extra stream on New Year's Day.

Help out by:
 * Following on [Twtich](https://twitch.tv/AnonJr_Live), and even watching when you have time! I have my streaming schedule posted there, and I sometimes do random extras - so if you follow you'll get notified when I go live.
 * Subscribing on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXafqhKHbkSUIrq0LAuu0tw), and even watching there from time to time. I'll post all my Live Stream replays there, as well as episodes and various other bits.
 * Support through [Stream Labs](https://streamlabs.com/anonjr_live) - this is pretty much running out of my back pocket. If you're enjoying the content, consider helping out with some of the costs by donating/tipping on my Stream Labs page.
