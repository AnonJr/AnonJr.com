title: "CoffeeCraft S03: Redstone Planning and Mob Farm Finishes"
description: "I start off the stream in my redstone testing world, working out the last few kinks with the plans for the furnace arrays.<br /><br />After that, we log into the CoffeeCraft server and make some progress on the mob farm. It was finished enough to AFK at after the stream, and is producing nicely."

Help out by:
 * Following on [Twtich](https://twitch.tv/AnonJr_Live), and even watching when you have time! I have my streaming schedule posted there, and I sometimes do random extras - so if you follow you'll get notified when I go live.
 * Subscribing on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXafqhKHbkSUIrq0LAuu0tw), and even watching there from time to time. I'll post all my Live Stream replays there, as well as episodes and various other bits.
 * Support through [Stream Labs](https://streamlabs.com/anonjr_live) - this is pretty much running out of my back pocket. If you're enjoying the content, consider helping out with some of the costs by donating/tipping on my Stream Labs page.
