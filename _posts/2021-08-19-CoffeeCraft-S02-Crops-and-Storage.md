title: "CoffeeCraft S02: Crops and Storage"
description: "Had a couple things that really needed to get done - build some crop farms and get a proper storage setup. I only got the crop farms done, but there's a micro farm that chews through bonemeal and a bigger semi-automatic farm that should be enough for me to manage on my own."
