title: "CoffeeCraft S03: Troubleshooting and Planning"
description: "Little more scattered today - server issues at the beginning of the stream really threw me off. Took some time to show off what was built over the weekend, and troubleshoot some issues. The last bit was trying to plan out the next few builds and get a better sense of what needs to be done."

Help out by:
 * Following on [Twtich](https://twitch.tv/AnonJr_Live), and even watching when you have time! I have my streaming schedule posted there, and I sometimes do random extras - so if you follow you'll get notified when I go live.
 * Subscribing on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXafqhKHbkSUIrq0LAuu0tw), and even watching there from time to time. I'll post all my Live Stream replays there, as well as episodes and various other bits.
 * Support through [Stream Labs](https://streamlabs.com/anonjr_live) - this is pretty much running out of my back pocket. If you're enjoying the content, consider helping out with some of the costs by donating/tipping on my Stream Labs page.
