Well... the last part is a bit of a stretch. I've had this account for quite some time.

I was recently updating my CV over at [Stack Overflow Careers](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/anonjr) and it occurred to me that one thing I'm really short on is publicly available projects and writing... time to fix that.

I would love to tell you that I have a plan, and can outline everything this blog will and will not be - but I'd be lying. Waiting until the plan coalesced is why it's now 2013 and I'm just now posting.

I *can* tell you that this is not going to have a singular focus. I will most likely have a heavy focus on tech as that's where I work and play - but I will also write about religion, politics, and maybe a few things of a more personal nature. Jeff Jarvis has often spoke of the therapeutic value of blogging about health issues (and I have a few) so I may throw a few of those out there as well.

We'll see where this goes...
