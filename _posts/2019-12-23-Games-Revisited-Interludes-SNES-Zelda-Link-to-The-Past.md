We're continuing the look back at the "Games of My Youth", this time going through some SNES games and a fun little sojourn through the 1990's. Today we go through The Legend of Zelda - A Link to the Past. Definitely a lot of memories and fun with this game. As with Ultima, if you'd like to see this game played through completely in a season of Games Revisited, leave a comment on the video.
