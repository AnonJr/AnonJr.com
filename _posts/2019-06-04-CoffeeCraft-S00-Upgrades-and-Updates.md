We finally upgraded to 1.14.2! Mostly today's a rambly day, with some actual outlines for future plans.

You can download the relevant files from the Vanilla Tweaks site if you want to use the textures, datapacks, and crafting recipes we're using:
 - [Server textures](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#eTitrj)
 - [Datapacks](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#pdHb1E)
 - [Crafting Extras](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#6j5spi)

I'm also using these [additional textures](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#Kobo6m).

Help out by:
 * Following on [Twtich](https://twitch.tv/AnonJr_Live), and even watching when you have time! I have my streaming schedule posted there, and I sometimes do random extras - so if you follow you'll get notified when I go live.
 * Subscribing on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXafqhKHbkSUIrq0LAuu0tw), and even watching there from time to time. I'll post all my Live Stream replays there, as well as episodes and various other bits.
 * Support through [Stream Labs](https://streamlabs.com/anonjr_live) - this is pretty much running out of my back pocket. If you're enjoying the content, consider helping out with some of the costs by donating/tipping on my Stream Labs page.
