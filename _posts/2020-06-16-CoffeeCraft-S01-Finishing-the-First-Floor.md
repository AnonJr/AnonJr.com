title: "CoffeeCraft S01: Finishing the First Floor (maybe)"
description: "Today we get some more work done on the first floor of our Cleric Cathedral. All 12 confessional booths are completed and ready to be occupied, the pews are in place (as is some lighting), and there's room for some decorations. We still need to finish the front, where the preacher will be; and we need to finish the door&hellip; though that might wait until we get the exterior done."
