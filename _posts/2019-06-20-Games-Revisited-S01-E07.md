Today we "finish off" the Mandalorian problem, deal with two feuding families, and find out about the Star Forge and the clues that are on the next four planets we need to visit. We chat with our crew and find out a little more, and find a stowaway on board. Before we get to the planets related to the Star Forge, we're going to check out this spot in Yavin that was already in the nav computer when we &hellip;acquired&hellip; the ship. That's where we logged out, and where we'll resume next week.
