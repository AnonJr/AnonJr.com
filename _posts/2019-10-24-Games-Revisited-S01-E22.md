Today we finish the final Sith Academy trial on Korriban, and get the final star map! We make a pit stop at the Yavin station for some gear and end up in a small skirmish&hellip;

Next week we head off for the Star Forge. There's most likely 2 to 3 more weeks of Season 1, and I've narrowed the game options for Season 2 down to two choices. I'll announce that either next week or the week after once I make sure they'll work right&hellip; the wayback machine might need a little dust cleared out of the cartridge. :smiley:
