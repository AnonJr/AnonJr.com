It's time for Episode 99 of Games Revisited Season 05. We're continuing our play-through of Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, and today we take one last tour of the Mandalorian camp, and then head back to Nar Shaddaa to deal with a couple small things before we head over to Korriban.

Watch live if you want to see the next 6-episode run as it's recorded. :smiley:
