description: "It's time for Episode 015 of Games Revisited Season 07. We're playing through the PC platformer/puzzler 'Trine: Enchanted Edition', with special guests Rayeste and Arcaidius from the CoffeeCraft server. Today we start our tour of the Iron Forge. Definitely one of the harder levels - and I'd agree that it's probably the hardest."
