I've had a few versions of this post floating around for longer than I care to think about. What follows is something closer to what I'd started around the same time I was working on the "13 Years in the Valley" retrospectives. For some reason I thought I'd more directly stated just how bad the burnout was, but after looking back I apparently only had the conversation as fully and expressedly in my head.

So let's start the *reflection* part of this endevour.

Burnout is one of those things that's been written about a lot lately, particularly in the tech industry. If you're not familiar, the Wikipedia page on [Occupational Burnout][7] is a good overview of the subject. [Dev.to](https://dev.to) also has a [couple][5] [articles][4] worth reading. While I've not quite hit [Happy to be Here][2] territory, [Furiously Happy][3] certainly had some chapters that resonated.

If I'm being completely honest, the warning signs were there in 2014. I may even get to some of that in a resumed rendition of retrospectives. In January 2016 I reached a point where I was at least willing to admit something was deeply wrong and find out just where I was at. So I took the [Maslach Burnout Inventory][6] and found the following results looking back at me:

&hellip;ouch.

I tried to work within the system, I tried counseling, and in the end it just wasn't getting better. In an ideal world I would have taken more regular time off, and I would have advocated for a more balanced life for myself, and recognized when the work environment was no longer healthy.

That would have been good then, so what to do now?

I remember a long time ago reading about how [we should all take sabbaticals][1]. At the time I read Joel's post I didn't really take it to heart. I'd just finished college, and was still only months into my brand new job. The idea that I could be so tired and run down that an extended time away was needed &hellip; I just couldn't comprehend it.

Now I get it. *Time to take a sabbatical.* December 15, 2017 I stepped down from full-time work and moved to a per-diem teaching position. The end of 14 years full-time work at Cape Fear Valley. Teaching was a nice way to keep up professionally, and get myself out of the house from time to time. Unfortunately, it was also still too much. So in June I quit completely.

To get ready for the sabbatical, in September 2017 I started working part-time at the local Music and Arts. I added the earnings to my current savings and pumped up what I was terming my "sabbatical fund".

Knowing that given my energy levels were what they were, I kept the job to make sure I'd get out of the house and actually engage in the time honored tradition of verbal communication with actual humans.

This is where the *changes* part was supposed to go, but I've run out of steam. Definitely to be finished before the month is up.
