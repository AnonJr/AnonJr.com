We're continuing our play-through of Chrono Trigger, and today we go to the Hunting Grounds to level up a little and chat. I try not to do the grindy stuff on camera, but we really need some higher tech/magic and with whatever sinus thing is trying to settle in I'm feeling a little too run down to press ahead without some more levels.

Watch live if you want to see the next 6-episode run as it's recorded. :smiley:
