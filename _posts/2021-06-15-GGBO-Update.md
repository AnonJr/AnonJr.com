title: Great Guitar Build Off 2021 Update
description: "Not the update I wanted to post&hellip; I've been struggling with a major depressive episode for longer than I care to mention. The guitar kits I ordered for practice are still sitting in the box behind me. If I can get it together enough I may still be able to get them done in time. But if I can't, I wanted to at lest have an update posted."

Help out by:
 * Following on [Twtich](https://twitch.tv/AnonJr_Live), and even watching when you have time! I have my streaming schedule posted there, and I sometimes do random extras - so if you follow you'll get notified when I go live.
 * Subscribing on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXafqhKHbkSUIrq0LAuu0tw), and even watching there from time to time. I'll post all my Live Stream replays there, as well as episodes and various other bits.
 * Support through [Stream Labs](https://streamlabs.com/anonjr_live) - this is pretty much running out of my back pocket. If you're enjoying the content, consider helping out with some of the costs by donating/tipping on my Stream Labs page.
