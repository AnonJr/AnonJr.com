Today Arcaidius, Rayeste, and I strip down most of the old Iron Farm collection system and Trading Hall. We build a new collection system and start work on the new Trading Hall, mashing together the base stall design from Avomance (<https://youtu.be/RCqNZOGiG_A>) and add the extra bit for the ejection system on the rail that Iskall85 used (<https://youtu.be/KkAfO281AZQ>) in one of his snapshot designs.
