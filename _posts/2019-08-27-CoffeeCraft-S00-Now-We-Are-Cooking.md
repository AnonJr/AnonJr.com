Today I build a Community Smelter, with 8 of each smelter in an array. It's a riff off of what Wattles built in his survival series (<https://www.youtu.be/B4PkAeAvguc>). It should be good for medium sized smelting jobs, and is "Bring Your Own Fuel" for now. We'll get to the ridiculously huge smelter running off of a massive bamboo farm later. :smiley:

I also catch up on some other things that happened over the weekend. If you'd like to help keep an admin in some much needed coffee, hit up the Stream Labs donation page below.
