It's time for Episode 81 of Games Revisited Season 05. We're continuing our play-through of Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, and today we take a little time to check in with the crew since it's been a while. Hopefully we can get an extra Jedi trained up.

Watch live if you want to see the next 6-episode run as it's recorded. :smiley:
