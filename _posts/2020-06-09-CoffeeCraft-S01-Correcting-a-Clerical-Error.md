title: "CoffeeCraft S01: Correcting a Clerical Error"
description: "Today was more of a planning/clearing/gathering day. We're going to build a cathedral of sorts, and staff it with a dozen clerics or so for trading. Either in the basement or off on a wing we'll also have a library with all the existing librarians and some new guys filling in the missing books."
