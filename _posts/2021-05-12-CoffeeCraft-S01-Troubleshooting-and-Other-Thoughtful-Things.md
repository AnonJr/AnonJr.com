title: "CoffeeCraft S01: Troubleshooting and other Thoughtful Things"
description: "Today I spend some time troubleshooting the Netherwart farm, get some help from a new follower, and then try to sort out a modest basalt farm - one that can run into the blast chamber (once it's working&hellip;) or can be run manually with a pick. It's mostly working by the end. The manual part that is."

Help out by:
 * Following on [Twtich](https://twitch.tv/AnonJr_Live), and even watching when you have time! I have my streaming schedule posted there, and I sometimes do random extras - so if you follow you'll get notified when I go live.
 * Subscribing on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXafqhKHbkSUIrq0LAuu0tw), and even watching there from time to time. I'll post all my Live Stream replays there, as well as episodes and various other bits.
 * Support through [Stream Labs](https://streamlabs.com/anonjr_live) - this is pretty much running out of my back pocket. If you're enjoying the content, consider helping out with some of the costs by donating/tipping on my Stream Labs page.
