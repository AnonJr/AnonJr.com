title: "CoffeeCraft S01: More Wart Farm?"
description: "After ruminating on expanding the Nether Wart Farm, I end up going with what I have and encasing it with glass to protect the player. Well, that&#39;s the plan. I end up side-tracked to fix a few things here and there before eventually installing the glass walls. At least I have Arcaidius for company. ðŸ™ƒ"

 * Subscribing on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXafqhKHbkSUIrq0LAuu0tw), and even watching there from time to time. I'll post all my Live Stream replays there, as well as episodes and various other bits.
 * Support through [Stream Labs](https://streamlabs.com/anonjr_live) - this is pretty much running out of my back pocket. If you're enjoying the content, consider helping out with some of the costs by donating/tipping on my Stream Labs page.
