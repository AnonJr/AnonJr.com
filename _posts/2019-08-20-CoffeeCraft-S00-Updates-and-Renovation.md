Quick update on the Iron Farm we built last week, and a look at the final redstone for the lighthouse from the week before.

After that we do some renovating in my hut, adding some automatic potion brewing stations designed by Cortezerino. I referenced a couple other designs, so here's the brewing stations mentioned:

 * Cortezerino's Potion Brewer: <https://youtu.be/-8j1U7tl8Gk>
 * Impulse's Potion Brewer: <https://youtu.be/HbFtJJc_Sok>
 * Pixlriffs Potion Brewer: <https://youtu.be/w8utSEJWMog>

I also talked about a couple redstone tutorials:

 * MumboJumbo's Redstone Circuits: <https://youtu.be/yhbvmbaIvcY>
 * LogicalGeekBoy's Dissecting Minecraft Series: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcSOIxw2nIE2OpQxG1ckMLsQ22Mu4Aiuc>
