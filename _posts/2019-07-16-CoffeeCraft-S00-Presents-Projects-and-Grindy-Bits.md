Today there's a quick summary of the new donations page at <http://live.anonjr.com> (powered by Stream Labs). Then we get to the present Arcaidius left outside my base. After that we do a quick tour of the progress on various projects around the server, finish up the mob dropper over by the guardian farm, and have a little fun for the last bit.

The unloading stations we looked at came from here:
 * Mumbo's Quick Video: <https://youtu.be/t-cWqvP8rw0>
 * Carrec Nannar's Video: <https://youtu.be/4bjAy1U23CQ>

You can get quick access to live and archives, and support the channel at <http://live.anonjr.com>
