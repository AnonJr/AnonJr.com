Today we start working our way to the Star Map on Korriban - last map before we head off to the Star Forge. Looks like we need to get to the top of the Sith Academy first though. We "acquired" a couple of tokens, and have started earning our spot at the top of the class. Next week we'll enter the valley and try to get a few more quests done.
