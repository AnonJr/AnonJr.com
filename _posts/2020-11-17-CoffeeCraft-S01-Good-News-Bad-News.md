Good News - the tree farm was constructed, and we now have a super productive cooked pork chop farm based off of [a video from LogicalGeekBoy](https://youtu.be/cKoXjXFw9uA).

Bad News - the tree farm had a flaw in the blast chamber, and it caused a backlog of a lot of blocks. We got most of the farm proper fixed by the end though.
