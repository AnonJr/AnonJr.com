&hellip;I'll blame it on the late start, but I should have double-checked given how often it's happened - XSplit randomly switched audio inputs, so there's only my mic. No Discord. No background or game audio. Just me. :confused:

Today we take a quick look at some updated redstone for the lighthouse, and then go on a fun trip through a bunch of old worlds and the two servers that preceded Season 00. I'll publish a cut version of the tour or re-record as Episode 01 later this week or the next.
