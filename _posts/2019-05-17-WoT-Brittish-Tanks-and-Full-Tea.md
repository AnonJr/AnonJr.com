We got a surprise raid early in the stream!

We start off with a bit of a British theme on the tanks, and get joined later by Hordesoflocusts and Fartrock. Unfortunately we couldn't get Discord working, so more me chatting to myself than us chatting together. :)

And to finish it off we paid it forward, raiding a fellow streamer playing some WoT himself. A fun evening all in all.
