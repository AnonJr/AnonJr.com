Today we work on the redstone for the Guardian Farm. It's going to be set up so that you can set it in passive mode, and the guardians die from fall damage; and you can set it in active mode and they'll fall onto honey blocks and be ready for you to quickly finish them off.

While I was doing that, Arcaidius built a tunnel to the underwater wreck that Medic spruced up so we'd have a proper way to get in and out.

Next week we'll get storage built and maybe do some work on the interior.
