title: "CoffeeCraft S03: Bees Knees"
description: "Got a couple small farms going to gather the materials needed to make larger versions - starting with two small bee farms. The foxes are out of the boat and in a small sweet berry farm, and the micro furnace array and small lava farm are back up too. Now to gather what's needed for the *proper* versions."
