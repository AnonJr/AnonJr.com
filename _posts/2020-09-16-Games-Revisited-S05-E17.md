It's time for Episode 17 of Games Revisited Season 05. We're continuing our play-through of Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, and today we finish making our way through the Harbinger, and hopefully have everything we need to grab the Ebon Hawk and get out of here.

Watch live if you want to see the next 6-episode run as it's recorded. :smiley:
