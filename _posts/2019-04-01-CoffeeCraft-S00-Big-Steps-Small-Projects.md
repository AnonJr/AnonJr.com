Arcaidius and I are streaming together, but working on separate projects. I make some more progress on the lake and waterfall on the side of my castle.

Fair warning: Audio still isn't working right&hellip;

Help out by:
 * Following on [Twtich](https://twitch.tv/AnonJr_Live), and even watching when you have time! I have my streaming schedule posted there, and I sometimes do random extras - so if you follow you'll get notified when I go live.
 * Subscribing on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXafqhKHbkSUIrq0LAuu0tw), and even watching there from time to time. I'll post all my Live Stream replays there, as well as episodes and various other bits.
 * Support through [Stream Labs](https://streamlabs.com/anonjr_live) - this is pretty much running out of my back pocket. If you're enjoying the content, consider helping out with some of the costs by donating/tipping on my Stream Labs page.

Ed: Ok, the audio is horrible and the video is no longer public on the YouTube channel&hellip; I kept this here more for historical reference.
