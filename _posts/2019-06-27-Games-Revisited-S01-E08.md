Today we check out the Yavin station, try to get our little stowaway taken care of (no, not *that* kind of taken care of - we're playing light side), and then run into technical issues and call it quits early&hellip; I took a short break, re-did the work from the stream, and then finished the stuff I said I would. We'll start on Tatooine in the next episode.
