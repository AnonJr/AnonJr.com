Today we finish "negotiations" with one of the two Rakata tribes, then make our way through the temple and turn off the field that kept us from the Star Forge. There were a few other surprises along the way. Next week we will start - and possibly finish - the last leg of the game and conquer the Star Forge. Tune in next Thursday at 6pm US-Eastern!
