It was that sort of day.

Since the weekend I was planning on working on the much expanding rubber duck in the church, and the fog that surrounds it. After fighting with weird CPU spikes and my computer completely seizing at moments I finally went live - to a raid that had accidentally been triggered by Arcaidius. And then the stream started glitching and dropping every 5 - 10 minutes. And my computer kept freezing. And other issues. At least the recording seems to be alright.
