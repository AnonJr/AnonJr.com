title: "CoffeeCraft S01: Redstone Big and Small"
description: "Working on a few redstone projects big and small before we wrap up the season. The Crimson Stem farm is a big, late-game project I wanted to do just to see if I could. The nano crop farm and the sweet berry farm I wanted to make sure worked before the next season."

Help out by:
 * Following on [Twtich](https://twitch.tv/AnonJr_Live), and even watching when you have time! I have my streaming schedule posted there, and I sometimes do random extras - so if you follow you'll get notified when I go live.
 * Subscribing on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXafqhKHbkSUIrq0LAuu0tw), and even watching there from time to time. I'll post all my Live Stream replays there, as well as episodes and various other bits.
 * Support through [Stream Labs](https://streamlabs.com/anonjr_live) - this is pretty much running out of my back pocket. If you're enjoying the content, consider helping out with some of the costs by donating/tipping on my Stream Labs page.
