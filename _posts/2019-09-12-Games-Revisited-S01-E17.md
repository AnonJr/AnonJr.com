We check in with our crew at the start, to make sure they don't have a burning desire to chat in the middle of a mission. :smiley:

From there we turn in the side-quest about where all the mercenaries went, and then get into the big mission - finding out what happened to the research base under the sea (and finding another star map).

After our court trial we make sure the crew is leveled up and do some preemptive chats. Wait, what trial? Watch and see&hellip;
