title: "CoffeeCraft S02: Redstone and The River... Again"
description: "I think I finally got the redstone for the Wool farm working right. Put some more glass down in the river project, and started laying the foundation for the Guardian farm. We're going to wrap up Season 02 at the end of the year and start Season 03 in a vanilla world running 1.18 in the new year. We're also looking for a new host now that Cubedhost is shutting down. ðŸ˜•"
