Today I go through the trial we tried to do two weeks ago when the game crashed mid-game&hellip; and after the trial we head out to the Sith base on our mission for the Republic, recover some equipment, and find some missing children. We're ready for the next step in the quest line, hopefully we'll get to the Star Map next week.
