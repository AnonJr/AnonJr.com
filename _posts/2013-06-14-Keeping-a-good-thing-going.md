I do a lot of Classic ASP/VBScript programming - It's what my bread-winning project is built in, it's what my side projects are built in, it's what Snitz Forums (a FLOSS project I help with) is written in.

One of the things that has made my life a little easier is a neat little ASP/VBScript framework over at&nbsp;[https://code.google.com/p/asp-ajaxed/](https://code.google.com/p/asp-ajaxed/).&nbsp;I've integrated it into the LMS I built for work, and a few other work-related projects. I *love*&nbsp;it.

Unfortunately, the owner passed away and the project has slowly faded away. Recently the main site disappeared... Not wanting to see a good code base go to waste, I've taken ownership of the project (with the blessing of one of the remaining project members).

I'm not sure where I'm going to begin in getting this thing back up and running, but I do want to keep this project alive and better maintained. Look for more updates to come. :)
