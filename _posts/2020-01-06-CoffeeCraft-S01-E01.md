For today's episode we're going to pick up relatively close to where we left off from the inaugural stream, and do a little island cleanup. If you didn't get a chance to see the stream, there are a few clips and the replay is in the Season 01 Livestream Playlist.

From there we build a couple early-game style farms to keep the food flowing.
