Lessons Learned:
* Script better
* Need to fix lighting
* I've become a bit of an audio snob - that lav just doesn't sound good enough anymore...
* Need to run power to the cameras while filming
* I'm not as funny as I think I am
* A few other things. (always hated "bug fixes and updates" on the list of "What's new" on a software page... yet here I am)

Also, the store I was trying to remember is Micro Mark and the file kit is here: <https://www.micromark.com/12-piece-Micro-File-Set>
