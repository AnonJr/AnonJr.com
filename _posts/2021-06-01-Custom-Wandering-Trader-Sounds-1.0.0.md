After making a resource pack that replaced the Villager voices, and having a lot more fun with it than I expected, I put this together for the Wandering Trader. It's still a little "Version 1"-ish. I never really worked on voices before, so getting something that is both different and usable is still a bit of a struggle.

The pack replaces all the wandering trader vocalizations with some actual audio work, voiced by me, and altered so it's not me listening to me every time a wandering trader spawns in the middle of my redstone.

If you like what you're seeing, and get some entertainment out of this resource pack, please consider [giving a little back](https://streamlabs.com/anonjr_live/tip). This is strictly value-for-value: give as much or as little as you think it's worth.
