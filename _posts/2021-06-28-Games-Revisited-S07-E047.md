description: "It's time for Episode 047 of Games Revisited Season 07. We're playing through the PC platformer/puzzler 'Trine 2: The Complete Story', with special guests Rayeste and Arcaidius from the CoffeeCraft server. Today we take on the big boss, and complete the last of The Goblin Menace expansion. After that it's back to The Belly of the Beast to grab the painting we missed so we can unlock the Dwarven Caverns."
