title: "CoffeeCraft S02: Rethinking My Farms"
description: "Having a little trouble arranging things, so I'm taking a step back and rethinking my farms and such. I took the time to remodel the slime farm while I was at it. It now has an off switch, and I can hook it up to a clock to flush the slimes faster. I plan on the mob farm running to the same storage/killing platform."
