I"ù<p>Wellâ€¦ the last part is a bit of a stretch. Iâ€™ve had this account for quite some time.</p>

<p>I was recently updating my CV over at <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/anonjr">Stack Overflow Careers</a> and it occurred to me that one thing Iâ€™m really short on is publicly available projects and writingâ€¦ time to fix that.</p>

<p>I would love to tell you that I have a plan, and can outline everything this blog will and will not be - but Iâ€™d be lying. Waiting until the plan coalesced is why itâ€™s now 2013 and Iâ€™m just now posting.

I <em>can</em> tell you that this is not going to have a singular focus. I will most likely have a heavy focus on tech as thatâ€™s where I work and play - but I will also write about religion, politics, and maybe a few things of a more personal nature. Jeff Jarvis has often spoke of the therapeutic value of blogging about health issues (and I have a few) so I may throw a few of those out there as well.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll see where this goesâ€¦</p>
