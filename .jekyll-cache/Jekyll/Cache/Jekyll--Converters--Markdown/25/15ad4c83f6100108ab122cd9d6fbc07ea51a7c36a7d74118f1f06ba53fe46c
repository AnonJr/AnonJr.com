I"<p>It seems a little ridiculous to tag this “NaNoWriMo”, but I’m not really sure what to call it. I’ve had a few posts in draft for longer than I care to mention, and while the desire has been there the energy has been lacking… most likely to be the subject of some upcoming posts.</p>

<p>For those who don’t know, <a href="https://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> is short for National Novel Writing Month. The idea being that you just start writing at the start of November, and work at a steady pace to have a completed work by the end of the month. Just writing, edit later. It’s a really nice idea for helping those of us who just need a little push to get started.

I’ve gone through the motions of starting a novel a couple of times, and unfortunately never actually followed through. My intent had been to actually participate this year and produce one of the two novels that’s been kicking around in the back of my mind for quite some time. Life being what it’s been, I just wasn’t ready to start and didn’t want to feel behind this early on.</p>

<p>So - new objective. Blogging has been another writing activity that I’ve long intended to do, but never seem to actually make happen. For the month of November my goal is to get at least one post out a day. By the end of November I’ll work out a more reasonable posting schedule. The hope is that once I get started, maintaining momentum will be a lot easier.</p>

<p>Look for some updates on old projects, some “talking out loud” type planning on upcoming projects, and a few other things.</p>

<p>Quite frankly I feel like an athlete who’s been on a long recovery finally getting back into training. Now that I think about it, that’s probably a more apt analogy than I’m ready to admit to.</p>
