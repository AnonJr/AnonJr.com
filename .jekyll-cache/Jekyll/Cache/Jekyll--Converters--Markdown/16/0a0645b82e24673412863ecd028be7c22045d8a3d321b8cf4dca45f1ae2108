I"ã<p>Iâ€™ve got the first live stream for <a href="https://www.coffeecraft.us/">CoffeeCraft</a> coming up this Monday at 7pm EDT (-4 UTC? I think? I hate Daylight Saving). I did a <a href="https://www.coffeecraft.us/2019/03/Test-Stream.html">test stream</a> a while back, and <a href="https://www.coffeecraft.us/2019/03/AnonJr-Live-Playlist-v1.html">downloaded some music</a> to run in the background. Iâ€™ve got a plan and now I need to burn off some nervous energy. Thereâ€™s probably a whole other post in there but I spent too much time today finding stuff to do instead of writing the stuff that was on my mind. With a little more work Iâ€™ll get the nervous slacking to actual writing ratio tipped in the other direction. :smiley:</p>
