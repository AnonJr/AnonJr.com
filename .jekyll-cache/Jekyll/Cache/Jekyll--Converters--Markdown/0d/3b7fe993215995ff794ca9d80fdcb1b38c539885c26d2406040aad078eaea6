I"é<p>I do a lot of Classic ASP/VBScript programming - Itâ€™s what my bread-winning project is built in, itâ€™s what my side projects are built in, itâ€™s what Snitz Forums (a FLOSS project I help with) is written in.</p>

<p>One of the things that has made my life a little easier is a neat little ASP/VBScript framework over atÂ <a href="https://code.google.com/p/asp-ajaxed/">https://code.google.com/p/asp-ajaxed/</a>.Â Iâ€™ve integrated it into the LMS I built for work, and a few other work-related projects. I <em>love</em>Â it.

Unfortunately, the owner passed away and the project has slowly faded away. Recently the main site disappearedâ€¦ Not wanting to see a good code base go to waste, Iâ€™ve taken ownership of the project (with the blessing of one of the remaining project members).</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not sure where Iâ€™m going to begin in getting this thing back up and running, but I do want to keep this project alive and better maintained. Look for more updates to come. :)</p>
