I"´"<p>Last November I posted about some <a href="/2018/11/Projects-Projects-Projects.html">ongoing projects</a>, went through through the various projects and gave a bit of a status report on them, and I mentioned my goals moving forward. Todayâ€™s going to be a breakdown of what happened between then and now, and whatâ€™s in store for the future.

<h2 id="first-things-first">First Things First</h2>
<p>Soâ€¦ what happened? Well, it was a combination of things. I had a string of bad days (more about â€œwhyâ€ in <a href="/2018/11/Sabbaticals-Reflections-and-Changes.html">Sabbaticals, Reflections, and Changes</a>), but I managed to at least post. Then, still feeling a bit low-energy, I made the â€œmistakeâ€ of taking up the invitation for company and sitting on the couch with <a href="https://www.coffeecraft.us/members/rayeste/">Rayeste</a> and <a href="https://www.coffeecraft.us/members/arcaidius/"> Arcaidius</a> and watching <a href="http://www.pbs.org/food/shows/great-british-baking-show/">The Great British Baking Show</a> while trying to type out a post on my Surface Pro. While the company was good and the show was fun to watch, I never quite got the post finished and posted.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve generally consoled myself by saying that a couple days later I probably would have stopped anyway. While on sabbatical Iâ€™ve been working retail sales, and Black Friday prep, Black Friday itself, Christmas shopping season, and a series of other work events took up quite some time (earning some nice OT too) from mid-November through the middle of January. Then in February I transferred to a different part of the company and Iâ€™ve been working on adjusting my schedule. I think Iâ€™ve got a handle on what I can fit in now. Here and there Iâ€™ve made some progress on a couple of projects, and Iâ€™ve got some good news in there too.</p>

<p>While that sounds reasonable, and I almost left it at that, I confess that there was more than a little inertia involved. And being â€œat restâ€ was awfully hard to overcome again. <em>Especially</em> as the gap grew from my last post grew.</p>

<p>So, using the same list as <a href="/2018/11/Projects-Projects-Projects.html">last time</a>, but front-loading what Iâ€™ve actually worked on, here we go:</p>

<h2 id="anonjrcom">AnonJr.com</h2>
<p>I did a little bit of tidying up around here. Changed up the nav bar a little, added some links (and now that Iâ€™m looking at it, missed a couple), updated the project pages, added a proper Favicon, and a few other bits and bobs. Iâ€™ve got more Iâ€™d like to do, but to be quite frank I suck at being both the client and the designerâ€¦</p>

<p>Part of the problem is I donâ€™t have a clear vision for what I want. Yet. In the spirit of moving forward instead of stalling I went ahead and went with the new Favicon design, and added it to a bunch of the accounts I run. I know Iâ€™ve missed a few, and I hope to have them squared away over the next week.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve also put a new header/banner up on my new <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/anonjr_live">Twitch</a>, <a href="https://mixer.com/AnonJr_Live?vod=91997262">Mixer</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXafqhKHbkSUIrq0LAuu0tw">YouTube</a>, and other accounts. The references in the by-line will be explained in the next two bits.</p>

<p>As much as I love the current background, Iâ€™ll probably switch it out for a photo I took on a trip to Arizona not too far back. I still need to switch this over from Pretzel to Jekyll, and work out a smoother deploy. I did get that <a href="/2018/11/Special-Feed-for-Dev.to.html">special feed</a> built though.</p>

<h2 id="coffeecraftus">CoffeeCraft.us</h2>
<p>One of the items on the aforementioned by-line, <a href="https://www.coffeecraft.us/">CoffeeCraft</a> is where the bulk of the work has been this month. To recap, itâ€™s a small survival Minecraft server that <a href="https://www.coffeecraft.us/members/rayeste/">my sister</a>, <a href="https://www.coffeecraft.us/members/arcaidius/">her husband</a>, and <a href="https://www.coffeecraft.us/members/anonjr/">I</a> have been playing on. Inspired by <a href="http://hermitcraft.com/">HermitCraft</a>, weâ€™ve fired up a fresh world for â€œSeason 00â€ so we can get used to working together in a way that works better for making videos and live streaming, and actually get used to streaming and making videos.</p>

<p>As you can tell by the links in the last paragraph, weâ€™ve got some â€¦ lightweight profiles together, a design thatâ€™s a little more â€œusâ€ than â€œtemplateâ€, and the stubs for content. Over the next week or so Iâ€™ll start adding content so I can make sure the various pieces all render like they should. Hopefully by mid-April it will be good enough to tag as version 1.</p>

<p>Also: Iâ€™ll be doing my first full CoffeeCraft stream on Monday March 25th at 7pm EDT (UTC-4 at the time of posting).</p>

<p>Iâ€™m using <a href="https://restream.io">Restream.io</a> to simultaneously stream to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/anonjr_live">Twitch</a>, <a href="https://mixer.com/AnonJr_Live?vod=91997262">Mixer</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXafqhKHbkSUIrq0LAuu0tw">YouTube</a> (where Iâ€™ll also have the video available afterward). I did a test stream earlier and everything seemed to work well, though Iâ€™ve still got a few things Iâ€™d like to figure out and set up on XSplit. I am a little worried about the chat - Restream.io is supposed to cross-post all the chat messages so everyone sees everyone elseâ€™s messages, but Iâ€™m wondering how moderation is going to work.</p>

<h2 id="some-other-game-streaming">Some other game streaming</h2>
<p>Now that Iâ€™ve got the streaming set up (well, mostly) I plan on going forward with two more streams: â€œGames Revisitedâ€ and â€œThe 47%â€ (the last two items on the new channel header).</p>

<p>Games Revisited is going to be once a week, live-to-tape (as it were), trip through some old and old-ish games. A nice chance to revisit some favorites and go through some games I missed back when they were first hot. Streams will be archived on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXafqhKHbkSUIrq0LAuu0tw">YouTube</a> channel. I hope it provides some nice nostalgia for those that played the games when they first came out, and I hope it exposes others to some games they never knew existed. Iâ€™ve got a few contenders in my Steam library, and in the next week or so Iâ€™ll start with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/32370/STAR_WARS__Knights_of_the_Old_Republic/">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a>. It was released in 2003. While Iâ€™d always intended to play it, I never actually got around to it.</p>

<p>The 47% is going to be done the same way, but itâ€™s going to be <a href="https://worldoftanks.com/">World of Tanks</a>. The name is a bit of a riff on the fact that most people have a 47% win rate, and quite frankly Iâ€™m not that good. Of all the projects Iâ€™ve got on my slate, this one might end up getting cut. Thereâ€™s a bit of ambivalence about Wargaming (the company that makes WoT) and the tenor of the community of late. On the other hand, I do still enjoy playing the game. And I could whine about the community <em>or</em> I could try to engage and encourage better behaviour. So weâ€™ll see how that goes.</p>

<h2 id="bible-by-example">Bible By Example</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.biblebyexample.com/">Bible by Example</a> has been on hold while I get the streaming channels up and running. I made a few minor updates to the site repository, and got it set up with HTTPS. As much as I really want to get this one going, Iâ€™d rather make the streaming/recording mistakes on my gaming bits than this show. So, this is going to sit on the back burner for another month or two.</p>

<h2 id="wayward-son-developers-d20-project-and-asp-ajaxed">Wayward Son Developers, D20 Project, and ASP-Ajaxed</h2>
<p>These projects have also been on hold for a bit. Once I get the <a href="https://www.coffeecraft.us/">CoffeeCraft</a> and <a href="https://www.biblebyexample.com/">Bible by Example</a> sites finished and settled, Iâ€™ll update <a href="https://www.waywardsondevelopers.com/">Wayward Son Developers</a> and make it a better portfolio type site. The others Iâ€™ll start picking up shortly thereafter.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping it up</h2>
<p>I really feel like Iâ€™ve forgotten something, but at this hour thatâ€™s not surprising. Tomorrow Iâ€™ve got one or two more post drafts that I plan on finishing off, and Iâ€™ve got to do a little more prep for Mondayâ€™s live stream.</p>
