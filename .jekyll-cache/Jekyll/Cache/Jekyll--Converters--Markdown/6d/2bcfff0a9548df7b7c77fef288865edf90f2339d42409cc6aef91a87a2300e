I"<p>I‚Äôve had a few versions of this post floating around for longer than I care to think about. What follows is something closer to what I‚Äôd started around the same time I was working on the ‚Äú13 Years in the Valley‚Äù retrospectives. For some reason I thought I‚Äôd more directly stated just how bad the burnout was, but after looking back I apparently only had the conversation as fully and expressedly in my head.</p>

<p>So let‚Äôs start the <em>reflection</em> part of this endevour.

Burnout is one of those things that‚Äôs been written about a lot lately, particularly in the tech industry. If you‚Äôre not familiar, the Wikipedia page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_burnout">Occupational Burnout</a> is a good overview of the subject. <a href="https://dev.to">Dev.to</a> also has a <a href="https://dev.to/mary_grace/burnout-what-happens-when-you-take-on-too-much-74d">couple</a> <a href="https://dev.to/wolfemurray/burnout-8hk">articles</a> worth reading. While I‚Äôve not quite hit <a href="https://www.popehat.com/2015/05/21/happy-to-be-here/">Happy to be Here</a> territory, <a href="http://thebloggess.com/furiously-happy/">Furiously Happy</a> certainly had some chapters that resonated.</p>

<p>If I‚Äôm being completely honest, the warning signs were there in 2014. I may even get to some of that in a resumed rendition of retrospectives. In January 2016 I reached a point where I was at least willing to admit something was deeply wrong and find out just where I was at. So I took the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslach_Burnout_Inventory">Maslach Burnout Inventory</a> and found the following results looking back at me:</p>

<p>I tried to work within the system, I tried counseling, and in the end it just wasn‚Äôt getting better. In an ideal world I would have taken more regular time off, and I would have advocated for a more balanced life for myself, and recognized when the work environment was no longer healthy.</p>

<p>That would have been good then, so what to do now?</p>

<p>I remember a long time ago reading about how <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/03/18/more-on-sabbaticals/">we should all take sabbaticals</a>. At the time I read Joel‚Äôs post I didn‚Äôt really take it to heart. I‚Äôd just finished college, and was still only months into my brand new job. The idea that I could be so tired and run down that an extended time away was needed ‚Ä¶ I just couldn‚Äôt comprehend it.</p>

<p>Now I get it. <em>Time to take a sabbatical.</em> December 15, 2017 I stepped down from full-time work and moved to a per-diem teaching position. The end of 14 years full-time work at Cape Fear Valley. Teaching was a nice way to keep up professionally, and get myself out of the house from time to time. Unfortunately, it was also still too much. So in June I quit completely.</p>

<p>To get ready for the sabbatical, in September 2017 I started working part-time at the local Music and Arts. I added the earnings to my current savings and pumped up what I was terming my ‚Äúsabbatical fund‚Äù.</p>

<p>Knowing that given my energy levels were what they were, I kept the job to make sure I‚Äôd get out of the house and actually engage in the time honored tradition of verbal communication with actual humans.</p>

<p>This is where the <em>changes</em> part was supposed to go, but I‚Äôve run out of steam. Definitely to be finished before the month is up.</p>
