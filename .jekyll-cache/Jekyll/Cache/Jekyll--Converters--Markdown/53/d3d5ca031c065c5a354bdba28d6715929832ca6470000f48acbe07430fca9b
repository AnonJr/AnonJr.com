<p>CoffeeCraft is a small, <a href="http://hermitcraft.com/">HermitCraft</a>-like Minecraft server and podcast built with my sister and her husband. The three of us plan on posting weekly videos independently, a few live streams, and a few collaborative projects.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re currently in what weâ€™re calling â€œSeason 00â€, a private session where we get set up and start working out the rules for the server and how weâ€™re going to operate. Iâ€™m posting a live stream archive and all videos over on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXafqhKHbkSUIrq0LAuu0tw">my YouTube channel</a>. You can watch the live streams there, on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/anonjr_live">my Twitch stream</a>, or on <a href="https://mixer.com/AnonJr_Live">my Mixer stream</a>. Twitch and Mixer should also have the last few live streams available for a bit.</p>

<p>You can get everything over at <a href="https://www.coffeecraft.us/">CoffeeCraft.us</a>.</p>
