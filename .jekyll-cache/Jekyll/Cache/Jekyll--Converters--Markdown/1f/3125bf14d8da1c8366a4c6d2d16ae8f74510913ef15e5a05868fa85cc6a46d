<p>Back in 2004, my boss asked me to integrate a support forum into our LMS. Since the system was written in ASP Classic, I looked through my options and settled on Snitz Forums.</p>

<p>I was an active member in the <a href="https://forum.snitz.com/forum/">support forums</a> for quite some time after - helping others, contributing various extensions, and working with the core dev team on the 3.4.07 release.</p>

<p>It’s been a while since I was active, but I’ll keep the reference here as working with this project was a major influcence in my growth as a programmer.</p>

<p>Check them out over at <a href="https://forum.snitz.com/">the main site</a>, and see the new .NET MVC version in action in the <a href="https://forum.snitz.com/forum/">support forums</a>.</p>
