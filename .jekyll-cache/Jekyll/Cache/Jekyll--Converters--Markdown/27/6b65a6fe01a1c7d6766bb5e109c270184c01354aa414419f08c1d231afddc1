<h1 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h1>

<p>Thatâ€™s a question I ask myself every dayâ€¦</p>

<p>Most would want to peg me as an IT â€œJack of all Tradesâ€ given my experience, capacity, and capability in graphics design, web programming, and server administration. Iâ€™ve even done some photography and acquired a wide assortment of other skills. Above all, I love learning - in just about every job Iâ€™ve had, Iâ€™ve always learned and grown beyond the original job role.</p>

<p>But all that sort of implies that the â€œJack of all Tradesâ€ is also the â€œMaster of Noneâ€, which isnâ€™t quite right eitherâ€¦ so letâ€™s go with a modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath#Renaissance_ideal:_the_Renaissance_man">Renaissance Man</a>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve done, and am mostly comfortable with, full stack development. Iâ€™ve been an educator, a coach (youth soccer, High School swimming), a Life Guard Instructor, Iâ€™ve done some factory work, and Iâ€™m starting up a <a href="http://biblebyexample.com">podcast</a> rooted in my love of theology. Iâ€™ve got a few writing projects in the works, and a potential game setting Iâ€™m working on with my sister and her husband.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve worked with some open source projects, Iâ€™ve adopted and adapted various projects to augment others. In 2013 I was researching options for upgrading a Classic ASP application I was maintaining. I stumbled across the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/ASP-Ajaxed/asp-ajaxed">Ajaxed.org library</a>. In addition to integrating it into various projects, I extended the core libraries to include some missing functions. After the main site went dark, I adopted this abandoned project and am continuing its development.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve done the same with other projects - altering the (now MIA) <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20101025073643/http://adamv.com/dev/asp/noodle/">Noodle Wiki</a> software to tightly integrate into the LMS I had developed for my employer. To add one of the few missing features, I spliced in the page difference function from <a href="http://openwiki.com/?OpenWikiNG">OpenWiki</a> and the BBCode parsing from Snitz Forums.</p>

<p>The majority of my work and writing are related to my current job, and are not publicly available.</p>

<p>One of my more visible side projects has been working with a local Christian Rock group - <a href="http://jesusjoshua2415.com/">Jesus Joshua 24:15</a>. Iâ€™ve been their photographer and webmaster, having built their website as a class project and growing it to their current site. Additionally, Iâ€™ve been their roadie, studio technician, and helped upgrade their recording studio.</p>
