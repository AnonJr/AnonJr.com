I"µ<p>Woot! <a href="https://code.google.com/p/asp-ajaxed/downloads/detail?name=asp-ajaxed_v2.1.1.zip">ASP Ajaxed 2.1.1</a> is up. :)</p>

<p>As I mentioned in an <a href="/2013/06/Keeping-a-good-thing-going.html">earlier post</a>, I took over the ASP Ajaxed project in the hopes of keeping it alive. Iâ€™m still orienting myself to how Google Code hosts projects, and Iâ€™m still trying to figure out just how Iâ€™m going to go about running this particular project.

One of the things I found when converting the source control from svn to hg was that there were some bug fixes that were not in the posted 2.1 release. I added a couple of fixes of my own, and a new feature - a SHA256() hashing function - and published <a href="https://code.google.com/p/asp-ajaxed/downloads/detail?name=asp-ajaxed_v2.1.1.zip">version 2.1.1</a>.</p>

<p>Hopefully soon Iâ€™ll have a little more about the plans and intentions for this little project.</p>
