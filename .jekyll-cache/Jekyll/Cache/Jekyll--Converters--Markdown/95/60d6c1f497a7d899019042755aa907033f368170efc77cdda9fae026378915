<p>Bible By Example is a podcast dedicated to covering Scripture in a way that enables discussion between believers and non-believers. This show is about going through the Christian scripture book by book, chapter by chapter, word for word - and we won’t skip the hard parts.</p>

<p>My goal is to do this in a way that enables discussion between believers and non-believers. This is not a preachy service, but a walk through what really is and isn’t in the scripture so we can have a constructive debate and not get distracted by arguing over things that aren’t really there in the first place.</p>

<p>I also want to be clear about what we will not be covering: we will not be going deep into the various issues and trivia that divide the different denominations. If there’s enough support on the Patreon page, I may set up a separate show for that purpose. This main podcast will remain centered around the core of Christian belief that is common to all denominations - what C. S. Lewis referred to as “Mere Christianity”.</p>

<p>The website has been started, and you can watch the progress over at <a href="https://www.biblebyexample.com/">BibleByExample.com</a>.</p>
