I"”<p>Back in January 2017 I started following what looked like a small and promising community of programmers (and those in adjacent fields) over at <a href="https://dev.to/">Dev.to</a>. At the time I had the site‚Äôs whole feed pumping into my Feedly list, I‚Äôd commented on a few posts, and I was starting to think about either revitalizing this blog or picking some other platform for posting.

In the end I decided to try and revitalize this site, beginning with <a href="/2017/07/A-Pretzel-A-Jekyll-Some-Pages-Cranky-Git.html">a bit on the tech</a> behind a couple of projects.</p>

<p>One of the things I‚Äôd considered at the time, and mentioned in <a href="/2018/11/Projects-Projects-Projects.html">Projects Projects Projects</a>, is setting up a custom RSS feed for just the articles I wanted to submit at Dev.To. I plan on publishing a wide variety of articles here, and I know not all of them will be right for the community there, so I want to make sure I‚Äôm filtering out the rest. I tried just running my regular RSS feed to my profile there, but it left a lot of cruft on my dashboard in the <em>drafts</em>, and even if I deleted the drafts they would just show up again on the next refresh.</p>

<p>Which brings us to this bit - I‚Äôve got a second RSS feed now with just the articles that I want to send over there.</p>

<p>In the front matter I have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">repost</code> variable like so:</p>

<figure class="pure-img">
  <img src="/img/2018-11-04-frontmatter.png" alt="(side note: need to fix the highlighting/rendering of markdown code in posts&hellip;)" class="pure-img" />
  
    <figcaption>
      (side note: need to fix the highlighting/rendering of markdown code in posts‚Ä¶)

    </figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>Originally I was going to set up a ‚Äúto-dev.to‚Äù tag, and go that way, but that didn‚Äôt seem useful for the people who were visiting my site.</p>

<p>And there‚Äôs now a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">todev.to.xml</code> that filters through the posts for just those that I want to republish.</p>

<figure class="pure-img">
  <img src="/img/2018-11-04-devtoxml.png" alt="DevTo XML" class="pure-img" />
  
    <figcaption>
      

    </figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>At my next opportunity, I‚Äôm going to try and pump it through the <a href="https://github.com/penibelst/jekyll-compress-html">Compress layout</a> and see if that can get the size down without breaking anything. Though now that I think about it, I‚Äôd have to either adapt it to work with <a href="https://github.com/Code52/pretzel">Pretzel</a> or do the Pretzel-to-Jekyll conversion first.</p>

<p>So there‚Äôs the short version. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a more efficient way to do this, but I probably won‚Äôt worry too much about it until I do the conversion to Jekyll. I don‚Äôt plan on adding any more features before then.</p>

<p>(Hot damn! that makes 4 for 4 on my ‚Äú<a href="/2018/11/Almost-NaNoWriMo.html">Almost NaNoWriMo</a>‚Äù!)</p>
