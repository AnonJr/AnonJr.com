		<p>Well... the last part is a bit of a stretch. I've had this account for quite some time.</p>
<p>I was recently updating my CV over at <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/anonjr">Stack Overflow Careers</a> and it occurred to me that one thing I'm really short on is publicly available projects and writing... time to fix that.</p>
<p>I would love to tell you that I have a plan, and can outline everything this blog will and will not be - but I'd be lying. Waiting until the plan coalesced is why it's now 2013 and I'm just now posting.</p>
<p>I <em>can</em> tell you that this is not going to have a singular focus. I will most likely have a heavy focus on tech as that's where I work and play - but I will also write about religion, politics, and maybe a few things of a more personal nature. Jeff Jarvis has often spoke of the therapeutic value of blogging about health issues (and I have a few) so I may throw a few of those out there as well.</p>
<p>We'll see where this goes...</p>
