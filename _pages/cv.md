## Summary
I am an IT "Jack of all Trades" with experience spanning web development, graphics design, and server administration. Over the years I‚Äôve also done photography, audio engineering, and training development ‚Äî giving me a diverse background and a reputation as a creative, adaptable problem solver.

I enjoy improving and extending existing systems, breathing new life into abandoned projects, and creating tools that make other people‚Äôs work easier. Many of my professional projects are internal to previous employers, but my public work demonstrates the same care for clarity and practical design.

## Experience

### Stringed Instrument Repair Technician
**Music & Arts** ‚Äî *Sep 2017 ‚Äì Present*
- Repaired and refurbished violins, violas, cellos, double basses, and guitars.
- Maintained shop tools and materials.

### Computer-Based Training Developer
**Cape Fear Valley Health System** ‚Äî *Dec 2003 ‚Äì Dec 2017*
For 14 years I worked in the Training and Development Department of a large health system (~6000 employees) as an IT "jack of all trades."

When I started at Cape Fear Valley, I wrote the online training system we now use. Until a decision was made to switch systems, I maintained and enhanced said system.

As an IT worker in the education department, I had an interesting mix of challenges and freedoms. While I did not have access to all the tools/services available to the hospital IT staff, I did have a lot of freedom in implementing whatever needed to be written to solve the task at hand.

My official title was "Computer-based Training Developer," and my job encompassed:
- Programming new features for the CMS we used for managing online education, classroom education, and the few hybrid courses we offered
- Performing CMS maintenance
- UI Design
- Database Admin. duties
- Server Admin. duties
- Testing
- Providing Tech Support for said system
- Performing Editorial/Publishing duties for the educational content
- Tackling any other job that comes with running the system
- Teaching classes including Nonviolent Crisis Intervention, CPR, ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support), and PALS (Pediatric Advanced Life Support)


### Lead Lifeguard, Assistant Swim Coach
**Fayetteville YMCA** ‚Äî *2001 ‚Äì Dec 2003*
In looking for a job with hours better suited to returning to school, I returned to Lifeguarding - this time at the Fayetteville YMCA, where I did the following:
- Taught Lifeguarding, First Aid, and CPR classes
- Taught all levels of the Swim America program
- Earned Level II Coaching License

I also acquired several other roles and certificaitons, including:
- Swim America Site Supervisor
- Lead Lifeguard
- American Red Cross Lifeguard Instructor
- Assistant Swim Coach for the AACY Swim Team and Cumberland County High Schools
- Certified Pool and Spa Operator's Licence


### Quilting Machine Operator, Order Fulfillment
**Jackson Mattress Company** ‚Äî *2000 ‚Äì 2001*
During my year-long semester off I worked at Jackson Mattress Company. In my short time there, I learned many skills and was:
- Cross-trained on 3 types of quilting machines
- Loaded trailers for the warehouse
- Implemented the electronic barcode system for the warehouse

## Education

**Guitar Repair Courses**<br />
*Colorado Institute of Musical Instrument Technology (CIOMIT), Jan ‚Äì Mar 2020*
- Coursework included setup, fretwork, structural repair, and finish care for electric and accoustic guitars.

**A.A.S. Computer Programming**<br />
*Fayetteville Technical Community College, 2001‚Äì2003*
After switching to Network Administration from the "I'm not sure what I'm doing" degree program, I found my home after taking the required Intro to Programming class. It was that semester I switched to Computer Programming (and the short-lived Media Integration Technology program).

My class project for Database Design and Programming was adopted by the Aquatics Department at the YMCA where I worked to track employee training, certification, and other records of note (e.g. write-ups, verbal warnings, positive notes).
