## Summary

I began my career in IT first building/upgrading computers in high school out of a cost necessity, and later discovering a love of programming in college. After college, I worked in Training and Development at Cape Fear Valley Health. I was involved in all aspects of online training - writing the system that was used for a decade, running the server and ongoing maintenance, copy editing, providing support, and whatever else was needed. I wasn’t just behind the computer — I was also teaching CPR, portions of ACLS and PALS, and Nonviolent Crisis Intervention.

During college and beyond I also did photography, repair work, and roadie work for a local Christian Rock band - Jesus Joshua 24:15. After leaving the hospital, I took a working sabbatical at Music & Arts Retail. I took some classes to fill in a few missing spots in my guitar repair repertoire. From there I moved into the Repair Shop side of Music & Arts until I needed to relocate - my stepfather unexpectedly passed away and my mother needed help.

One throughline in every job, every role, every company is that I’m a lifelong learner. I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge. I love sharing what I know too. Each project is another opportunity to grow and share what I have learned.

## Experience

### Stringed Instrument Repair Technician
**Music & Arts** — *Sep 2017 – Nov 2025*

I started on the Retail side as part of a "working sabbatical", where I assisted the manager in improving inventory management, updating computer assets, and whatever else was needed in addition to sales responsibilities.

In Jan 2019 I transferred from the Charlotte Retail store to the Charlotte Repair Shop, where I detailed and inspected various instruments for return to the retail stores to be rented again.

In Nov 2020 I transferred to the Burlington Repair Shop and my role as a Stringed Instrument Repair Technician. Mostly I repaired and refurbished Repair and refurbish violins, violas, cellos, double basses. I also worked on guitars, mandolins, ukuleles, and the occasional banjo setup.

### Computer-Based Training Developer
**Cape Fear Valley Health System** — *Dec 2003 – Dec 2017*

For 14 years I worked in the Training and Development Department of a large health system (~6,000 employees) as an IT "jack of all trades."

When I started at Cape Fear Valley, I wrote the online training system we used. Until a decision was made to switch systems, I maintained and enhanced that system.

As an IT worker in the education department, I had an interesting mix of challenges and freedoms. While I did not have access to all the tools and services available to the hospital IT staff, I had a lot of freedom in implementing whatever needed to be written to solve the task at hand.

My official title was "Computer-Based Training Developer," and my job encompassed:
- Programming new features for the CMS used to manage online, classroom, and hybrid education.
- Performing CMS maintenance.
- UI design.
- Database administration duties.
- Server administration duties.
- Testing.
- Providing technical support for the system.
- Performing editorial and publishing duties for educational content.
- Tackling any other job that came with running the system.
- Teaching classes including Nonviolent Crisis Intervention, CPR, ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support), and PALS (Pediatric Advanced Life Support).

### Lead Lifeguard, Assistant Swim Coach
**Fayetteville YMCA** — *2001 – Dec 2003*

In looking for a job with hours better suited to returning to school, I returned to lifeguarding — this time at the Fayetteville YMCA, where I:
- Taught Lifeguarding, First Aid, and CPR classes.
- Taught all levels of the Swim America program.
- Earned a Level II Coaching License.

I also acquired several other roles and certifications, including:
- Swim America Site Supervisor.
- Lead Lifeguard.
- American Red Cross Lifeguard Instructor.
- Assistant Swim Coach for the AACY Swim Team and Cumberland County High Schools.
- Certified Pool and Spa Operator’s License.

### Quilting Machine Operator, Order Fulfillment
**Jackson Mattress Company** — *2000 – 2001*

During my year-long semester off, I worked at Jackson Mattress Company. In my short time there, I learned many skills and was:
- Cross-trained on three types of quilting machines.
- Responsible for loading trailers for the warehouse.
- Implemented the electronic barcode system for the warehouse.

## Education

**Guitar Repair Courses**
<br />
*Colorado Institute of Musical Instrument Technology (CIOMIT)* *Jan – Mar 2020*

- Coursework included setup, structural repair, basic electronics, and finish care for electric and acoustic guitars.

**A.A.S. Computer Programming**
<br />
*Fayetteville Technical Community College* *1999-2000, 2001–2003*

After switching to Network Administration from the "I’m not sure what I’m doing" degree program, I found my home after taking the required Intro to Programming class. It was that semester I switched to Computer Programming (and the short-lived Media Integration Technology program).

My class project for Database Design and Programming was adopted by the Aquatics Department at the YMCA where I worked to track employee training, certification, and other records of note (e.g., write-ups, verbal warnings, and positive notes).
