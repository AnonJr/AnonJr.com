## Summary

I began my career in IT, first building computers out of necessity and later discovering a true passion for programming. After college, I worked in Training and Development at Cape Fear Valley Health, where I wasn‚Äôt just behind the computer ‚Äî I was also teaching CPR, ACLS, and Nonviolent Crisis Intervention. Over the years, my journey evolved from writing code to repairing stringed instruments, but my love for problem-solving has always remained the same.

I‚Äôm a lifelong learner, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge ‚Äî from software systems to physical instruments. Today, I bring that systems-oriented mindset to the repair bench, helping restore and maintain the quality of every instrument I work with. Each project, whether teaching a class or reworking a violin, is another opportunity to grow and share what I know.

## Experience

### Stringed Instrument Repair Technician
**Music & Arts** ‚Äî *Sep 2017 ‚Äì Present*
- Repair and refurbish violins, violas, cellos, double basses, and guitars.
- Maintain shop tools and materials.

### Computer-Based Training Developer
**Cape Fear Valley Health System** ‚Äî *Dec 2003 ‚Äì Dec 2017*

For 14 years I worked in the Training and Development Department of a large health system (~6,000 employees) as an IT "jack of all trades."

When I started at Cape Fear Valley, I wrote the online training system we used. Until a decision was made to switch systems, I maintained and enhanced that system.

As an IT worker in the education department, I had an interesting mix of challenges and freedoms. While I did not have access to all the tools and services available to the hospital IT staff, I had a lot of freedom in implementing whatever needed to be written to solve the task at hand.

My official title was "Computer-Based Training Developer," and my job encompassed:
- Programming new features for the CMS used to manage online, classroom, and hybrid education.
- Performing CMS maintenance.
- UI design.
- Database administration duties.
- Server administration duties.
- Testing.
- Providing technical support for the system.
- Performing editorial and publishing duties for educational content.
- Tackling any other job that came with running the system.
- Teaching classes including Nonviolent Crisis Intervention, CPR, ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support), and PALS (Pediatric Advanced Life Support).

### Lead Lifeguard, Assistant Swim Coach
**Fayetteville YMCA** ‚Äî *2001 ‚Äì Dec 2003*

In looking for a job with hours better suited to returning to school, I returned to lifeguarding ‚Äî this time at the Fayetteville YMCA, where I:
- Taught Lifeguarding, First Aid, and CPR classes.
- Taught all levels of the Swim America program.
- Earned a Level II Coaching License.

I also acquired several other roles and certifications, including:
- Swim America Site Supervisor.
- Lead Lifeguard.
- American Red Cross Lifeguard Instructor.
- Assistant Swim Coach for the AACY Swim Team and Cumberland County High Schools.
- Certified Pool and Spa Operator‚Äôs License.

### Quilting Machine Operator, Order Fulfillment
**Jackson Mattress Company** ‚Äî *2000 ‚Äì 2001*

During my year-long semester off, I worked at Jackson Mattress Company. In my short time there, I learned many skills and was:
- Cross-trained on three types of quilting machines.
- Responsible for loading trailers for the warehouse.
- Implemented the electronic barcode system for the warehouse.

## Education

**Guitar Repair Courses**
<br />
*Colorado Institute of Musical Instrument Technology (CIOMIT)* *Jan ‚Äì Mar 2020*

- Coursework included setup, fretwork, structural repair, and finish care for electric and acoustic guitars.

**A.A.S. Computer Programming**
<br />
*Fayetteville Technical Community College* *2001‚Äì2003*

After switching to Network Administration from the "I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm doing" degree program, I found my home after taking the required Intro to Programming class. It was that semester I switched to Computer Programming (and the short-lived Media Integration Technology program).

My class project for Database Design and Programming was adopted by the Aquatics Department at the YMCA where I worked to track employee training, certification, and other records of note (e.g., write-ups, verbal warnings, and positive notes).
