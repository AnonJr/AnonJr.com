## Summary
I am an IT "Jack of all Trades" with experience spanning web development, graphics design, and server administration. Over the years I‚Äôve also done photography, audio engineering, and training development ‚Äî giving me a diverse background and a reputation as a creative, adaptable problem solver.

I enjoy improving and extending existing systems, breathing new life into abandoned projects, and creating tools that make other people‚Äôs work easier. Many of my professional projects are internal to previous employers, but my public work demonstrates the same care for clarity and practical design.
