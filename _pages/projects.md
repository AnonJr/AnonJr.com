Wayward Son Developers is a web development team consisting of Me, Myself, and I. Me handles the back-end coding and server management, Myself is more into the design/layout and front-end work, while I just supervise and occasionally handle marketing.

In all seriousness, I wanted something other than my personal name to publish some of my solo development work under - and this was it.
