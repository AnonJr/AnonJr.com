title : Games Revisited
---

Games Revisited is my "Let's Play" series where I go through classic games I played in my youth (or games from around the same timeframe that I missed). The goal is a brisk pace, but not a speed run - I want to enjoy the game and offer those who haven't played a good look at the story and experience.

I'll list the "seasons" in reverse chronological order, so the newest are the easiest to find.

## Season 05: Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords
For Season 05 of Games Revisited, we went back to the PC side of gaming and played &ldquo;Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords&rdquo;, the sequel to our Season 01 game. For our run we added the "Restored Content Mod" so we could get the bug fixes and additional content the game deserves.

## Season 04: Illusion of Gaia
For Season 04 of Games Revisited, I play through the old SNES game &ldquo;Illusion of Gaia&rdquo;. I'm running a ROM through the BSNES emulator to play the game this time. Since this game got lost somewhere along the way there's not exactly a lot of call for a Steam port.

## Season 03: Portal and Portal 2
For Season 03 of Games Revisited, I play through &ldquo;Portal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Portal 2&rdquo;. Portal 2 is probably about as "new" as I want to get with this series at this particular time, though we'll see how long that lasts.

## Season 02: Chrono Trigger
For Season 02 of Games Revisited, I revisit &ldquo;Chrono Trigger&rdquo; - one of my favorite SNES games via the Steam port. I want to see how many achievements I can get without playing through each and every ending.

## Season 01: Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
For Season 01 of Games Revisited, I play through &ldquo;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&rdquo; for the first time. I'll stick to a more or less good character for this play through.

## Season Interludes
Sometimes the holidays and other life events line up such that I can't start the next season immediately after the one I just finished - that's when I go through some random games just for kicks during the interlude.
