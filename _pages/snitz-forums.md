Back in 2004, my boss asked me to integrate a support forum into our LMS. Since the system was written in ASP Classic, I looked through my options and settled on Snitz Forums.

I was an active member in the [support forums](https://forum.snitz.com/forum/) for quite some time after - helping others, contributing various extensions, and working with the core dev team on the 3.4.07 release.

It's been a while since I was active, but I'll keep the reference here as working with this project was a major influcence in my growth as a programmer.

Check them out over at [the main site](https://forum.snitz.com/), and see the new .NET MVC version in action in the [support forums](https://forum.snitz.com/forum/).
